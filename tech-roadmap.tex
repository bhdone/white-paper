\chapter{Tech Roadmap}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item August 3, 2018: The BHD genesis block was mined. It initiated a new mining method, and first month of unconditional storage mining.
    \item Sep 4, 2018: BHD started conditional PoC experiment.
    \item When the whole network computing power enters a positive growth cycle, adds elastic economic. Model according to the community consensus.
    \item Capacity size reaches 3000 peta bytes, implements zero knowledge function, improves TPS.
    \item Capacity size reaches 6000 peta bytes, upgrades PoC consensus.
    \item Capacity size reaches 10000 peta bytes, builds the stable currency system using capacity as standard, services for the application layer.
    \item In 2023, BHD will be compatible with Chia's old agreement documents for mining.
\end{enumerate}
